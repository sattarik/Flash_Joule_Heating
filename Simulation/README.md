Input to the COMSOL multi-physics simulation as reported in “FJH_simulation_V02.xlsx”

1) Cylinder diameter: 8 mm
2) Distance between the electrodes as the length of the simulated cylinder was calculated based on the mass and the kind of precursor materials as following: 

PS_weight * Norm_MPS + Mass_weight*mass (mg) = Length in (mm)

PS_weight = 0.01
Norm_MPS = MPS/maximum (MPS) 
Mass_weight = 0.05
Note: We reached such an empirical equation by approaching an average length of 20 mm as in experiment. 

3) We considered 140, 130, 120, and 113 (S m-1) for the electrical conductivity and 0.4, 1.2, 2.2, and 2.7 (W m-1 K-1) for the thermal conductivity of the starting materials CB, PA, MC, and TCB, respectively.

4) As input voltage we considered:
Capacitancei*Voltage0 / max(Capacitance)
Note: We reached such an empirical equation to reach the estimation of maximum temperature of 5000K. 5000K was recorded in other experiments reported by Dr. Tour’s group. 

5) pulse time.
