## directory: ./
SML_final.ipynb: contains the main code for running the experiment in Jupyter notebook. It contains blocks of code for regenerating the figures in the manuscript. It saves each figure in the correct directory. 

## directory: ./Time_current_property_extraction
contains one sample of current-time curve and a code for extracting I_max, I_final, Charge Density, and I_mean. 
## directory: ./Simulation 
contains simulation input variables for each sample. The simulation file in COMSOL is very large. It can be accessed through request to Dr. Jian Lin. 
## directory: ./Fig*
contains figures generated in the main file
